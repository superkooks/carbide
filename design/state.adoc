# State and mutations

## State
All of the state for each guild is stored in a JSON object, with the exception of <<_chat_messages>>.
The state is mutated by mutations.

## Mutations
Mutations are represented by a method, path, and (optionally), an object.
The path is determined using the following rules:

- Objects are indexed by their keys.
  For instance, `.foo` would access the property of the object called `foo`.
- Arrays are indexed by the `id` of their underlying object.
  For instance, a channel `{id: 1234}` could be accessed using `.channels.1234`

There are 2 methods: `SET`, `DELETE`.

NOTE: The `id` field of an object should never be updated.

```
{
    "method": "SET",
    "path": ".messages.1234567890",
    "object": {
        "id": "1234567890"
        ...
        "content": "New message"
    }
}

{
    "method": "SET",
    "path": ".messages.1234567890.content",
    "object": "Updated message content"
}

{
    "method": "DELETE",
    "path": ".messages.1234567890"
}
```

## Chat messages
Chat messages are batched into groups of 500 KiB, with the remaining bytes padded with zeroes.
They are retrieved by batch when necessary, in order to reduce memory consumption and speed up indexing.
