# State and mutations

## State
All of the state for each guild is stored in a JSON object, with the exception of <<_messages>>.
The state is mutated by mutations.

## Mutations
Mutations are represented by a method, path, and (optionally), an object.
The object must be the entire object, containing all fields.

There are 3 methods: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

NOTE: The `id` field of an object should never be updated, but must be included as a field.

```
{
    "method": "INSERT",
    "path": ".messages",
    "object": {
        "id": "1234567890"
        ...
        "content": "New message content"
    }
}

{
    "method": "UPDATE",
    "path": ".messages.1234567890",
    "object": {
        "id": "1234567890"
        ...
        "content": "Updated message content"
    }
}

{
    "method": "DELETE",
    "path": ".messages.1234567890"
}
```

## Messages
Messages are batched into groups of 500.
They are retrieved by batch when necessary, in order to reduce memory consumption and speed up indexing.
