= Design Decisions
:toc:

== About this document
This document is not an exhaustive list of design decisions made.
It functions as a place to describe the rationale for decisions that affect the service as a whole.


== General
Many of these decisions are based on properties charted in the https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/edit#gid=0[Digital Communications Protocols Spreadsheet].

[#opensource-client]
=== Opensource client
The client will be open source.

This means that the cryptography can be trusted, and prevents me (or a law enforcement/intelligence agency) from changing the crypto from under you.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Cryptography can be trusted.
|May encourage custom clients, fracturing the ecosystem

|Prevents me (or an intelligence agency) from changing the crypto from under you
|
|===

=== Opensource server
The server will be open source.

This means that anyone can run their own server, just in case the worst happens.
Probably the only realistic scenario is if I make a really unpopular move.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Anyone can run their own server, just in case the worst happens.
|May fracture the ecosystem

[#identifier]
=== Anonymous / Pseudonymous
An external identifier (e.g. email, phone number) is not required to create an account.

One of the biggest downsides of Signal is the requirement for a phone number.
One, it ties your activity to an external identifier, and two, it means everyone needs a sim card in order to use the service (which goes against the idea of widespread adoption of strong encryption).

It doesn't make much sense for a private and secure messaging app to require not just one of the least secure identifiers (think of the sim swap attack), but require you to give it out to people you want to speak to.
Of course, if someone gets your phone number, the surface area of attack increases dramatically, just think of all the iMessage vulnerabilities.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Doesn't tie your activity to an external identifier
|Allows bots/spammers to easily create accounts (mitigated by making user discovery difficult)

|Increases the adoption of strong encryption
|

|Increases privacy when you let people talk to you
|

=== Local messaging
Local message will not be supported.

Local messaging is the transmission of messages when the internet doesn't work.
A possible case would be a solar storm knocking out power grids, or a serious BGP mishap.

Local messaging just doesn't make sense.
If the internet goes down, the only remaining widely available communication networks will be Bluetooth, and LAN.
These do not have nearly enough range to offer any improvement over walking to the person you want to chat to.
Perhaps Apple could get away with making a huge mesh network to transfer data, but we aren't so lucky.

A possible use case would be if one community is isolated from another, one person can travel to another community to share the other's messages.
This is a cool concept, but most people don't want to have a conversation with half hour round-trip times.
The chance that an entire community will gather during some kind of blackout in order to send out someone to sync there messages is pretty small.
If people really needed to talk to someone, they would find them in person.


[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Allows users to (maybe) communicate when the internet goes down
|Increases complexity significantly

|
|Increases user storage requirements
|===

=== Decentralization
It will be centralized.

WebRTC is a good guide to the challenges that peer-to-peer systems face.
It uses STUN and TURN to allow users to communicate with each other directly.
STUN allows two users behind NATs to connect to each other, as long as neither user has a symmetric NAT.
TURN can be used in this case, which effectively just proxies the connection.
Furthermore, WebRTC requires a signalling layer to transport its ICE candidates, which of course requires another public server.
Even WebRTC is not fully decentralized.

If servers with public ip addresses are required to connect peers to each other, it means the service cannot be fully decentralized.
That leaves us to the goodwill of a few users, or perhaps a requirement for each group to run their own server.
However, if we continue to optimize from that point, it just leaves us with a federated service.

The one potential benefit of a decentralized system is much stronger censorship resistance over a federated or centralized service.
With a centralized service (or even federated service with one large provider), the service could easily be shutdown by a court order.
With a decentralized service, anyone can start their own server to allow the entire network to connect.
However, a decentralized service could still be killed.
A user cannot know which server to connect to, without first connecting to a central, well-known server, which is a clear point of failure.
There is no way around the boot strapping problem.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Partial censorship resistance (DoS)
|Requires public servers

|Partially reduces metadata exposure
|Increases networking requirements

|
|Increases complexity significantly

|
|May require a synchronous protocol (all parties must be online to receive a message)
|===

=== Federation
It will not be federated.

There is a really good https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/[article] by the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, on federation.
Basically, federation has all the downsides of decentralization, (a fixed, unchanging protocol that is stuck in time), and the downsides of centralization (metadata is still being shared with huge providers).

Another example I would like to bring up is Matrix, which is a much more recent protocol than XMPP.
We can see this same pattern developing in even it.
The most common provider (or homeserver, in Matrix parlance) by far, is matrix.org itself.
This means that users lose the benefit of federation (the control over metadata), and it set the protocol in stone, as all servers must support the protocol in its current form.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|(Potential) control over metadata
|Prevents changes to protocol (necessary in an accelerating ecosystem)

|Partial censorship resistance (DoS)
|Increases complexity
|===

=== Open spec
The specification for the protocol will be open.

This will allow so many more possibilities for developers to further improve the ecosystem (e.g. bots).
Since the client will be <<opensource-client,open source>> anyway, it doesn't make sense to try hide it.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Allows developers to improve the ecosystem
|May encourage custom clients and incompatible, derivative specs, fracturing the ecosystem

|Can't exactly be kept a secret anyway, given the client is <<opensource-client,open source>>
|

|Encourages community to work together to improve security and add features
|
|===

=== Messages are stored on-device
Messages are stored on-device for the same reason that we have <<_forward_secrecy>>, so they can be deleted.
In my belief, it is not possible to design a system would have forward secrecy while storing the messages on the server in such a way that they could be accessed from anywhere with only one password.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Would allow users to access their messages from anywhere
|Likely impossible without breaking forward secrecy
|===

=== Device compatibility
[cols=2*]
|===
|Web
|The application will be web-native.

|Desktop
|Desktop will be supported with an Electron app. Unfortunately this is the easiest way to achieve cross-platform support.

|Mobile
|Mobile will be supported using a PWA. It makes it super easy to make a near-native app, without the hassle of dealing with the platforms individually. Unfortunately for iOS users, this means they will be unable to receive push notifications until someone buys an Apple Developer License. Sorry, I don't make the rules around here. Blame Apple.

|Terminal
|Initially, terminal will not be supported. However support could be eventually incorporated. Focus should initially remain on the other clients, as they will make up 95% of users and have very significant code-sharing in terms of the front-end. Terminal will have almost nothing in common with them except for the cryptography, so it makes very little sense to start working on them until the other clients work.

== Encryption
=== Post-quantum security
It will be secure against quantum computers.

Both elliptic curve cryptography and RSA are at risk of being broken by 2030.
It is estimated that the number of qubits required to break Curve25519 is only around 2330. footnote:[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06752.pdf[Quantum Resource Estimates for Computing Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithms]]
As of 2022, the largest number of qubits every produced is 216, by Xanadu's Borealis.
If we estimate the number of qubits to double every 2 years (which it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_processors[does]), then by 2030, we will likely have enough qubits to break Curve25519.
Another 2 or 4 years later, and we will have enough to break 4096-bit RSA.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Means your messages will be safe after 2030
|Increases complexity
|===

=== Forward secrecy
Forward secrecy ensures that once a message has been deleted, it is gone, even if an adversary was sniffing traffic and eventually got access to the keys.
This is important because otherwise, it may be impossible to delete a message, without deleting the key itself.
For a more detailed explanation, see https://alexgaynor.net/2017/apr/26/forward-secrecy-is-the-most-important-thing/.

Of course, most user's don't delete their messages once they have read them, but for the user's that do, or those who use disappearing messages, this feature is vital.

[cols=2*]
|===
|Pros |Cons

|Means your messages will be safe after 2030
|Increases complexity
|===

=== No deniability
Deniability means that it cannot be proved that the contents of the message originated from a sender.
Theoretically, this is great, you can say whatever you want and not have it attributable to you.
However, in reality, it is almost pointless.
The real solution is not letting anyone get a copy of the messages in the first place, such as by using disappearing messages with <<_forward_secrecy>>.

[%hardbreaks]
*Premise:* Given SMSs do not contain a cryptographic signature, they are a deniable protocol.
*Premise:* Courts regularly admit SMSs as evidence
*Conclusion:* Courts admit deniable protocols
*Conclusion:* Courts must rule on claims of forgery

Indeed, courts do have rules on "authenticating" evidence, so clearly having a deniable protocol does not help signficantly.

[quote,Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, UNITED STATES v. CALDWELL]
____
Authentication or identification under https://casetext.com/rule/south-carolina-court-rules/south-carolina-rules-of-evidence/article-ix-authentication-and-identification/rule-901-requirement-of-authentication-or-identification?searchWithin=true&listingIndexId=south-carolina-court-rules.south-carolina-rules-of-evidence&q=901&type=rule&sort=relevance&p=1[rule 901] merely involves the process of presenting sufficient evidence to make out a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie[prima facie] case that the proffered evidence is what it purports to be. Once that prima facie showing has been made, the evidence should be admitted, although it remains for the trier of fact to appraise whether the proffered evidence is in fact what it purports to be.
____

[quote,South Carolina Court of Appeal, Opinion No. 5868]
____
Like email, authorship can be determined
by the circumstances surrounding the exchange of
messages; their contents; who had the background
knowledge to send the message; and whether the parties
conventionally communicated by text message.
____

Things only get worse even if you aren't in court, in the court of public opinion, the bar for evidence is so low that they even admit hearsay.
Even if you claim the message is forged, very few people will believe you.

If you want actual deniability, use disappearing messages with <<_forward_secrecy>>.

|Your messages were never deniable anyway
|Messages provably originated from your device

== Frontend
=== Security
The weak point of any end-to-end encrypted service is the client itself.
If the client is compromised, then it is impossible to deliver a secure service.
It is also impossible detect a compromise (or lack thereof) with any certainty, as the client sits behind the operating system.

However, assuming the client's operating system is intact, we can secure ourselves against the more trivial attacks.

==== Desktop
Electron apps are particularly vulnerable, as they have app.asar files that can be trivially changed without admin permission, granting the attacker complete control over the application, and persistence, without even escalating.
This issue can't even be solved by signing the executable, as the app.asar file is not integrity checked.

This issue could potentially be solved using https://tauri.app/[Tauri], which packages all application data in one monolithic binary, and has numerous other security measures.
It also significantly reduces bundle size, by not including an entire chromium binary.

For the highest security, the user should clone the desktop app, and the webapp source code, and checkout the latest release.
The user should verify the integrity of the files received by checking the signature.
The user can then build the webapp and desktop app (and preferably store the checksum for later comparison).
The desktop app embeds the web assets and serves them for them.

This process reduces the reliance on external parties to 0.
By using only opensource code, we avoid any compromised CI/CD servers and other supply-chain attacks.
Integrity checks prevent a MiTM and allow the code to be approved by any third party that the user trusts.
The process also provides a simple way to check integrity of the binary, which prevents most trivial attacks.
Of course, an attacker could still attach a debugger or use a rootkit, etc. to attack the application.
The user is still responsible for keeping their system safe.

==== Mobile
On mobile, where we use PWAs, we cannot rely on our own server to serve requests for assets.
Instead we must cache them locally, using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API[Service Workers].

The process for installing the PWA is much the same as for desktop, but instead of cloning the desktop app, the PWA can be installed using the assets served from a desktop hosting the webapp, which are then cached locally.

Unfortately, the integrity of these assets cannot be fully verified by the user, as they may have been altered by another app, and most phones do not provide a mechanism to calculate checksums.
Of course, even if this were the case, a rootkit or debugger would still allow an attacker to attack the application.
